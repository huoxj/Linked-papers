In one pertinent, well-motivated attack scenario, an adversary may attempt to evade a deployed system at test time by carefully manipulating attack samples. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based approach that can be exploited to systematiï¼Œ In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based approach that can be exploited to systemati")
